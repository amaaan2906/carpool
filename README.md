## 1. Problem

It is not easy for **students** to find other **students** to carpool. They must rely on groups or forum posts to find a suitable carpool that will take them to their destination safely.

<!-- Over the years it has become even harder to find a carpool with the increasing number of social platforms and the challenges that come with each platform. -->

Students are also becoming increasingly worried about their **safety** when join or hosting a carpool to the point where they use other methods besides social platforms. This makes it difficult for students to find a carpool as there is no **centralized** and **safe** board for posting and joining carpools

## 2. Solution

The app is meant to be a **safe** and **easy-to-use** service where students organize and join carpool rides with ease and peace of mind.

Takes less than 5 mins to start using:

> 1. Create an account using you university email<sup>[1]</sup>
> 2. Verify using your university email
> 3. Add a name and picture<sup>[2]</sup>
> 4. Start carpooling ðŸ˜Š
